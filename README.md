## About the Video Course
Zurb Foundation is one of the most diffused best performing front-end design frameworks out there.

Dealing with browser compatibility, media queries, style consistency, and effective layouts could be a huge pain today, but Foundation comes to the rescue. With minimal effort, it allows you to create a production ready, responsive website or is a great starting point for a highly customized project.

Building a Responsive Site with Zurb Foundation will show you every major aspect of the framework, as well as general best practices and workflow tips, guiding you through the process of creating a live mock-up for a photography website. Every video will introduce some of Foundation's features and will use them to enhance the website in order to provide a practical experience with all the topics.

The course begins with an empty folder, where we'll install the Zurb Foundation framework and will start adding new pages and enhancements to cover all the key aspects of the framework itself.

We begin our journey by explaining why there is a need for a framework, how to set up a modern working environment, and how to scaffold a new project with Zurb Foundation. We'll then immediately introduce some responsive design key concept as well as the advantages of a mobile-first approach and how Foundation helps us with these scenarios.

As we advance through the course, we'll introduce all the major aspects of the framework, translating them in working code for our website. We are going to deal with navigation techniques as well as typography, content elements, and forms. As we come to an end, we'll emphasize how to deal with media elements in a responsive environment, trying out different approaches to effectively show image galleries both on desktop and mobile.

Underscore.js is a library of utility functions for JavaScript that helps to minimize the complexity most users face in building programs, that is, simplifying their JavaScript code. It can be used with any other library or framework and provides many useful methods for this very reason. It works great as an addition to jQuery, Angular.js, Backbone.js, or any other framework you might be using, or you can use it with plain old JavaScript.

Rapid Underscore.js is a quick introduction to making the most of the Underscore.js library. Using a practical example project it shows you not just how but why you would want to use Underscore.js’ methods.

We’ll start off by learning what the Underscore.js library is and why you would want to use it, and discover how to incorporate Underscore.js into an existing Browser or Node.JS-based project. Further, we will dive deeper into the Underscore.js concepts that can help us deal with arrays and objects using Underscore's functions for filtering, grouping, and sorting. We will explore JavaScript’s “this” context to manage binding and see how new functions can easily be made by partially applying the existing functions. We’ll control the running of a function using debounce, throttle, once, and after, and also how this leads to simplifying techniques when building user interfaces and dealing with outside data sources. Finally, we'll learn Underscore’s HTML templating abilities and chaining and finish up with a brief taste of libraries that extend Underscore.

By the end of this course, you will understand how Underscore.js helps you to efficiently develop web applications using a functional approach to JavaScript.
